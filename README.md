# Hey there! My name is Wilfredo! Take a seat🪑!
### Who am I ?
I graduated from [Neumont](https://www.neumont.edu/) with a Bachelors in Software Engineering. I currently work as a QA Automation Engineer and I was hired from being an intern there (I guess they liked me 🙂)
#### My Hobbies
- I love speedrunning 🙂 I play Super Mario 64 and I'm top 10 in both 0 and 1 Star. Currently not as good at 16 star but im working on it.
- I also make music and have been making beats since I was 15 (FL Studio🌶️)
- Quirky keyboards are my thing too, I currently use a 42 key ortholinear row staggered split keyboard (Corne). I manually built this keyboard and learned soldering from building this keyboard (it was an upgrade from the iris keyboard). 

### What are my plans
Right now I am working on a Speedrunning tool for Super Mario 64 Speedrunners! I have many project ideas to hopefully help runners improve more efficiently and faster. It also might look really cool :)
